The UAS Technikum Wien has been dealing with smart homes and assistive technologies for 10 years.
During this successful period, around 10 third-party funded projects, more than 40 publications or press releases, guest lectures and workshops were handled.
More than 120 bachelor's and more than 50 master's theses were implemented.
In addition, more than 15 gender mainstreaming & diversity management activities were carried out.

In May 2019 the new Smart Living Lab of the UAS Technikum Wien was completed.
On over 250 m^2^ usable area consisting of living area, wet room and bedroom, kitchen and seminar areas, equipped with modern smart home and assistive technology, we now have an ideal laboratory for future teaching and exciting research projects.

## Description

In the Smart Living Lab of the Electronic Engineering Faculty of the UAS Technikum Wien, smart homes and assistive technologies are researched and tested.
Assistive technologies support people with special needs and the elderly and allow them to achieve a high degree of autonomy in everyday life.
An integral core aspect of assistive technologies are smart homes, i.e. the intelligent automation of people's immediate living environment.
Among other things, control and regulation tasks from the areas of lighting, shading and air conditioning play a role here.

The necessary infrastructure is available in the laboratory, e.g. to enable user tests with those affected or the testing and integration of new technologies.
A typical apartment consisting of a living room with TV, radio, DVD player, couch, tablets ... was set up and smart home technologies for light, heating and air conditioning (KNX, EnOcean, BACnet, proprietary systems, ...) were integrated.
There is also a wet area, a kitchen and a bedroom.
In addition, a number of alternative input interfaces or assistive technologies (eye trackers, lip mice, buttons, infrared interfaces, ...) are available that are linked to the smart home and thus enable control.
For example, the light can be switched on and off or the door opened using an eye tracker or tablet.
Furthermore, service robots and eHealth technologies were integrated into the laboratory.

## Benefits

The laboratory is used for teaching in various courses.
As part of work in seminar groups, the students can be trained in a practical way using the built-in hardware and software.
Sufficient space is available for small groups or projects so that students can prototype their scientific work and evaluate it in a real environment.
As part of R&D projects, the faculty employees can carry out user tests in a typical living environment.
In addition, new open standards and technologies can be integrated into the living environment in order to evaluate them.
The laboratory is also available to partners to find out about current standards and technologies as well as their integration into an overall system.
